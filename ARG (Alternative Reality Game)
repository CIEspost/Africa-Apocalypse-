Our marketing campaign, or what can now be called the AA Instagram ARG (Alternative Reality Game)â€Š

Having a longer-term strategy and execution plan on how to continuously scale and grow the initiative is key.
- After creating an avatar, users are invited into a virtual world where they can have fun and explore
- There will be rewards and a leaderboard too
- There will eventually be product giveaways and downloadable, digital gifts.
- Gamification initiatives should be designed and launched 
incrementally and iteratively.
- There will be continuous improvements - like new rewards, skills, levels and powerups.
