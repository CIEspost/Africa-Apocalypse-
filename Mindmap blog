The Afrikaner Apokolips Game Develpoment Roadmap 
Who? What? Why? Status Update #1

Who?
The Afrikaner Apokolips team currently consist of a skeleton crew of programmers and artists.

What?
The game is currently in the pre-production and design phase
- this is the main planning phase of the game development process and is focused on idea and concept development as well as the 
production of initial design documents. 
"The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation, 
which describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development team.
The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan." 
- Chandler, Heather Maxwell, The Game Production Handbook

The first step in this phase is to define the game's 'High Concept', which we have done already 
- read all about what our game is about here.

Next up will be the first part of the Game Proposal.
Yes, this is where we will divulge some juicy details about the game's core features -
Keep a lookout for our teaser content coming out soon! 

And then, last but not least (at all) we will be showcasing features for you to choose which you would like to see incorporated 
in the final product most - all the while creating concept art and asset sketches to springboard the development of real game assets.

Why?
We started this game as an ode to 'the player' and we intend to see our vision through to the end.
Game Development is an iterative process in which work gets done incrementally, 
this allows us to incorporate player feedback in each stage of the game development process.
Afterall this game is meant to be enjoyed by you! 
This is why we will be posting weekly status updates to keep you in the loop at all times.
Check out our latest retrospective here.
