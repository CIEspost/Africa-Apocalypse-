WWW? WHY ARE WE HERE?
We are making AFRIKANER APOKOLIPS game It's our FIRST game!!!!!!! 

Currently the game is in the pre-production and design phase. 
This is the main planning phase of the game development process and is focused on idea and concept development and 
production of initial design documents. 
"The goal of concept development is to produce clear and easy to understand documentation, 
which describes all the tasks, schedules and estimates for the development team.
The suite of documents produced in this phase is called production plan."

We are currently focusing on the Game Concept
A game concept is an idea for a game, briefly describing its core play mechanisms, who the players represent, 
and how they win or lose.

why am i telling this to audience?
A game concept may be "pitched" to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are pitched to potential film producers.
fortnite and people's stories as reason to make game
Game publishers may solicit game concepts rom several designers before picking one to design a game,
There will eventually be product giveaways and downloadable, digital gifts for those who engage
