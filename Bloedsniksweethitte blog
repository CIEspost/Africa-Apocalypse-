“I live my life with stories that came before me. I tell stories because of stories that were told
before. I wrote a story, a screenplay, called Duiwelsdorp ‘Devil Town’ because of stories that
were told before me, to me and now a story lives within me. I am a storyteller because I am a
woman, born from woman, alive through story. I am a woman because I give birth - to story,
who actually first gave birth to me…It is in this sense that I then take up my place next to this
“new generation of post-apartheid South African filmmakers” (storytellers/historians) and
assume the duty of reminding my society “of its near and distant origins, of the experiences
that shaped it, of its cultural wellsprings” (Confino, 1997: 1187). I took it upon myself to tell
another real story of South Africa, the story of Johannesburg, the story of Duiwelsdorp
(2015)… By choosing to tell the story of Jack McKeone and other white outlaw heroes,
Duiwelsdorp (2015) challenges the popular notion of criminality and delinquency in South
Africa. ” - Carla Espost in Duiwelsdorp (2015): A Sangoma’s Story of South Africa.

Point of comic is to be manual for ARG - world BG info
Start with the beginning (introduce the goal), middle (overcome challenges), and end (realize an altered/improved state). 
Later you can build simple and complex interactions (game mechanics) as well as twists around the basic story elements.
"In the Robots Are Eating The Building ARG (discussed here), 
the story of the robots was used to kick off the game during the opening session of the conference."
"With all the conference attendees in the auditorium, 
the host directed everyone to a pretend “live” feed from the security desk (it was a recorded video). 
The security area was being introduced as a hub for information and directions if attendees needed assistance during the conference."
"As the feed from the security desk was being highlighted and emphasized as a place for information and directions, 
the other feeds began to go fuzzy and out of focus. 
Screams were heard in the background. 
Text replaced the video feeds to proclaim, “Robots Are Eating the Building! Play If You Dare!!!” 

^ context for the comic book as manual - I will have to create the teaser info and then create call to action at end of comic publishing
>> what comes after comic book

```The story for an ARG should provide direction and context for gameplay. ```
The ultimate player reward may be winning the game, winning a prize, or receiving some other sort of recognition.
But, the story goal should be about saving the day, discovering a new opportunity, or overcoming adversity, both at an individual and group level.
- reward for participation can be avatar created by me or something 
"The robot story also promoted gameplay by providing a theme and overarching goal (defeat the robots and save the building)."

"Med Bot, Mil Bot, Ed Bot, Biz Bot, Consult Bot, and ID Bot were then introduced as the robots eating the building.
A URL where conference attendees could register to play was displayed as the final screen of the video.
```The story was used to draw the players into the game. 
It also provided additional context to the cards in the attendee packets that players used to participate in the game. ```
