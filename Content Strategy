- Use instagram and make artworks based on engagement 
- Make at least one Bettie and Clive story post per week that beckons more egagement from audience, also posting other products

I have been planning the content for week 1 and have realized that it takes quite long to ready the content 
Each product will have posts such as:
- the product (painting)
- the instagram post (various media)
- blog
