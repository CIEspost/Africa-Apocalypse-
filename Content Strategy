- Use instagram and make artworks based on engagement 
- Make at least one Bettie and Clive story post per week that beckons more egagement from audience, also posting other products

I have been planning the content for week 1 and have realized that it takes quite long to ready the content 
Each product will have posts such as:
- the product (painting)
- the instagram post (various media)
- blog

*Still need to do Instagram Manual to determine if this strategy is valid, writing blogs seems to be alot of work on top of the 
posts themselves, but then again, it is good marketing, so I will start this and see how it goes.
