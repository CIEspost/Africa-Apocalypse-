The history of Mzansi from 2015 to the present

2015 - 2024
A score of Boere left South Africa after Presient Jacob Zuma
Teh new EFF parlaimant ruled for the nationalization of all land, renamed South Africa to Mzansi 
and Cape Town to //Huui !Gaeb, amongst others.
After this majority of the English population fled the country for Europe where most of them have always held passports.
Australia and Canada opened its doors for South Afrikaner refugees.
Thus it came to be that only a handful of Afrikaners and South African English liberals remained.
This was the generation of the 'Last Afrikaners' who became the progressive few who affiliated more 
with their country of birth than majority of their racist ilk.

2025 - 2030
A series of climatic catastrophes struck the globe, 
after which Africa was the only landmass that remained.
The so-called 'First world' leaders built underwater cities for themselves and their children. 
But alas, they could not save all.

2030 - 2075
The majority of the world's population fled to Africa and so hundreds of new African megalopolises were borne.
The new world order was run from the United States of Africa, with Mzansi as the preeminent state
and //Hui!gaeb as the capital.

Presently (2075) the environment is in tethers; 
mass drought and famine rule the overtly shipping dominated economy 
whereas the mass fracking and oil industries have destroyed all landmass to the point of no return. 
The West might still hold dominance over the world’s economies, 
but their technological advanced underwater cities do not hold the key to their citizen’s happiness. 
Europeans have flocked to Africa in large numbers, seeking wealth in Africa’s sunlight and what is left of it’s culture and traditions.
