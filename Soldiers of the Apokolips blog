"Apocalypse" (ἀποκάλυψις) is a Greek word meaning "revelation", 

"an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known and which could not be known apart from the unveiling".

Early A.M.'s. 

Why always these ones make me feel so courageous, 

like wandering hoodie, 

hood down in the streets 

– city vibes, 

like a revolutionary without a cause.

I feel like this has been something I've learned about life through media. 

I mean is this really glamorous?

Anyhoos I guess a simulation is real afterallz...

Even if the universe is a simulation I am feeling, 

experiencing, 

being alive, maybe Grandma's life in my head, 

her stories, all those ideas, 

feelings I've never felt and even came up with myself, 

now manifested within me is just as real as I am feeling them.

A simulated memory. 

Do I dream of electric sheep?
