The Sultans.

I should make sure to get them into the network, this will help me and Clive sort something out in order to get down country again.

I heard some of the Sultans aren't to be messed with.

Someone once asked me if I'm scared, this other dude, some smuggler too.

I said, “Well, you know, being scared is one thing, but wanting what I want is another”.

I'm not so sure he understood really, well, me neither to be honest, but I couldn't really understand why I'm not scared myself see.

Sometimes it's just like you want something so bad you completely forget to listen to your fears, it's almost like the fear becomes the adrenaline rush that spurs you on to do more of this crazy thing your doing.

I dunno, what do you think?
